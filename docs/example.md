## Button Styling

Then `.btn` rule defines the basic styling for buttons, and the `.btn-submit` rule defines the styling for submit buttons.

The `.btn-primary` rule defines the primary styling for buttons that should stand out, typically used for important calls to action like "Submit" or "Save."

## Usage

Here's how to use this rule in your HTML:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
```

## Example

<div class="example-container">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <button class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button>
</div>

## Developer Notes

- Use `.btn-primary` sparingly to maintain emphasis on important actions.
